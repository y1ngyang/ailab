<p>You will probably want to use the Python feature called <i>list comprehensions</i> at some point in this lab, to apply a function to everything in a list.

</p>
<dl><dt>A note on nomenclature
</dt><dd>Wherever possible, we try to be consistent with our use of certain keywords. In particular, the words <i>clause</i>, <i>expression</i>, and <i>statement</i> are often vague and overloaded, but we attempt to use them consistently in this lab:
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> IF, THEN, and DELETE commands are <b>clauses</b>.
</li><li> AND, OR, and NOT commands are <b>expressions</b>.
</li><li> Simple phrases like <tt>'opus is a penguin'</tt> or <tt>'sibling (?x) (?y)'</tt> are <b>statements</b>.
</li><li> AND and OR expressions comprise zero or more <b>statements</b> and expressions; NOT expressions comprise a single <b>statement</b>, which is semantically negated.
</li></ul>
<p>We also often refer to rules themselves as expressions. However, the context of use should make the intended meaning clear.
</p>
<a name="A_Production_Rule_System"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> A Production Rule System </span></h2>
<p>In this section, we explain the basic structure of <i>production rule system</i>. There aren't any problems to solve, but please read it carefully anyway.
</p><p>A production rule system is instantiated with a list of <i>data</i> and a list of <i>rules</i>:
</p>
<ul><li> A <b>datum</b> (plural, <b>data</b>) or an <b>assertion</b> is simply a string statement declaring a fact or a relation, e.g. <tt>'Jake is a person'</tt>.
</li><li> A <b>rule</b> is a combination of a predicate (<i>antecedent</i>) and a resultant action or set of actions (<i>consequent</i>).
</li></ul>
<a name="The_anatomy_of_a_rule"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> The anatomy of a rule </span></h3>
<p>Conceptually, a rule is a mechanism that lets us conclude things, or 
take some actions, based on what things we already have or know.
</p><p>Syntactically, a rule is an idiom that contains certain keywords 
such as IF, AND, OR, NOT, THEN, and DELETE. Importantly, rules can 
contain variables such as <tt>'(?x)'</tt> or <tt>'(?y)'</tt>. This 
allows a rule to match more than one possible datum. The consequent of a
 rule can contain variables that were bound in the antecedent.
</p><p>Here is an example of a rule:
</p>
<code><pre> IF( AND( 'parent (?x) (?y)',
          'parent (?x) (?z)' ),
     THEN( 'sibling (?y) (?z)' ))
</pre></code>
<p>This could be taken to mean:
</p>
<dl><dd>If <i>x</i> is a parent of <i>y</i>, and <i>x</i> is a parent of <i>z</i>, then <i>y</i> is a sibling of <i>z</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p>Given the dataset <tt>['parent marge bart','parent marge lisa']</tt>, executing the above rule would produce the datum <tt>'sibling bart lisa'</tt>. (In this particular case, executing it could also produce the datum <tt>'sibling bart bart'</tt>, which is a slight issue that we will deal with later.)
</p><p>Of course, the rule system doesn't know what these arbitrary 
words like "parent" and "sibling" mean! It doesn't even care that these 
words occur at the beginning of the statements. Indeed, the rule could 
also be written like this:
</p>
<code><pre> IF (AND( '(?x) is a parent of (?y)',
          '(?x) is a parent of (?z)' ),
     THEN( '(?y) is a sibling of (?z)' ))
</pre></code>
<p>Then, it will expect its data to look like <tt>'marge is a parent of lisa'</tt>,
 and so on. Writing data in more human-readable formats like this does 
come at a cost: the assertions and rules become wordy, and rule-matching
 involves unnecessary matching of symbols like <tt>'is'</tt> and <tt>'a'</tt>. We will use a mixture of these styles in this lab.
</p><p><i>Just remember that the English is for your benefit, not the computer's.</i> The computer's only concern is to pattern-match the data with the rules.
</p>
<a name="IF_.2F_THEN_Clauses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> IF / THEN Clauses </span></h3>
<p>In this lab, a rule must always have an IF and a THEN clause. 
Optionally, a rule can also have a DELETE clause, which specifies some 
data to delete.
</p><p>The IF clause (antecedent) is either a single statement or a single AND, OR, or NOT expression:
</p>
<ul><li> AND requires that multiple statements are matched in the dataset
</li><li> OR requires that at least one of multiple statements are matched in the dataset
</li><li> NOT requires that a statement is <i>not</i> matched in the dataset.
</li><li> AND, OR, and NOT expressions can be nested within each other. 
When nested, these expressions form an AND/OR tree (or, perhaps more 
accurately, an AND/OR/NOT tree). The <i>leaves</i> of this tree are string statements, possibly containing variables.
</li></ul>
<p>The THEN clause (consequent) contains at least one statement. When the rule <a href="https://ai6034.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Lab_1#Match_and_Fire" title="Lab 1">fires</a>, each statement in the consequent is added to the dataset (unless already present).
</p><p>The DELETE clause is optional, and contains at least one statement. When the rule <a href="https://ai6034.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Lab_1#Match_and_Fire" title="Lab 1">fires</a>, each statement specified in the DELETE clause is removed from the dataset (if present).
</p>
<a name="Match_and_Fire"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Match and Fire </span></h3>
<p>The terms <b>match</b> and <b>fire</b> are important. A rule <b>matches</b> if its antecedent matches the existing data. A rule that matches can then <b>fire</b> if its THEN or DELETE clauses would <i>change</i> the data. Otherwise, it fails to fire.
</p>
<a name="An_Iteration_of_Forward_Chaining"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> An Iteration of Forward Chaining </span></h2>
<p>The rules and assertions of the system are supplied in a specified order.
</p><p>During an iteration of forward chaining, the system will check 
each rule in turn: for each rule, the system searches the data, in 
order, for assertions that match the requirements of the rule's 
antecedent. Assertions that appear <i>earlier</i> in the data take precedence over assertions that appear <i>later</i> in the data. 
</p><p>If an AND or OR expression comprises multiple statements, we always try to match those statements <i>in the order given</i>.
 This is particularly important for AND expressions, because if one of 
the AND expression's statements contains variables and we match that to a
 datum, we must apply those same variable bindings to the subsequent 
statements in the AND expression.
</p><p>For example, consider the data <tt>['Bill has chocolate','Alex has chocolate','Alex likes eating chocolate']</tt> along with the rule
</p>
<code><pre>IF (AND( '(?x) has chocolate',
         '(?x) likes eating chocolate' ),
  THEN( '(?x) is happy' ))
</pre></code>
<p>In an iteration of forward chaining, the system would try to match this rule to the data by doing roughly the following:
</p>
<ol><li> Check the first part of the antecedent (<tt>'(?x) has chocolate'</tt>) against the first assertion, <tt>'Bill has chocolate'</tt>. This is a successful match, binding <tt>(?x) = Bill</tt>.
</li><li> Apply the binding <tt>(?x) = Bill</tt> to the second part of the antecedent, yielding <tt>'Bill likes eating chocolate'</tt>.
</li><li> Check <tt>'Bill likes eating chocolate'</tt> against <tt>'Bill has chocolate'</tt>. No possible match.
</li><li> Check <tt>'Bill likes eating chocolate'</tt> against <tt>'Alex has chocolate'</tt>. No possible match.
</li><li> Check <tt>'Bill likes eating chocolate'</tt> against <tt>'Alex likes eating chocolate'</tt>. No possible match.
</li><li> Dead end, so back up.
</li><li> Check the first part of the antecedent (<tt>'(?x) has chocolate'</tt>) against the second assertion, <tt>'Alex has chocolate'</tt>. This is a successful match, binding <tt>(?x) = Alex</tt>.
</li><li> Apply the binding <tt>(?x) = Alex</tt> to the second part of the antecedent, yielding <tt>'Alex likes eating chocolate'</tt>.
</li><li> Check <tt>'Alex likes eating chocolate'</tt> against <tt>'Bill has chocolate'</tt>. No possible match.
</li><li> Check <tt>'Alex likes eating chocolate'</tt> against <tt>'Alex has chocolate'</tt>. No possible match.
</li><li> Check <tt>'Alex likes eating chocolate'</tt> against <tt>'Alex likes eating chocolate'</tt>. This is a match.
</li><li> Conclude that this rule matches the data with <tt>(?x) = Alex</tt>
</li></ol>
<p>Of all the rules that match, the system picks the first such one that
 can fire, and fires it, adding/deleting assertions as necessary. If no 
matching rule can fire, forward checking immediately terminates.
</p>
<a name="A_Notice_about_NOTs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> A Notice about NOTs </span></h3>
<p>If there is a NOT expression in the antecedent, the data is searched to make sure that <i>no data item</i> matches the pattern.
</p><p>For example, the antecedent
</p>
<code><pre> NOT( 'Mary is a penguin' )
</pre></code>
<p>matches the data <tt>['Phil is a penguin','Sue is a penguin']</tt>, because <tt>'Mary is a penguin'</tt> is not a member of the data.
</p><p>However, the antecedent
</p>
<code><pre> NOT( 'Phil is a penguin' )
</pre></code>
<p>does <b>not</b> match the data <tt>['Phil is a penguin','Sue is a penguin']</tt>, because <tt>'Phil is a penguin'</tt> is a member of the data.
</p><p>Things get a little bit more complicated when we introduce variables in NOT expressions.
</p><p>The antecedent
</p>
<code><pre> AND( '(?x) is a bird',
      NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' ))
</pre></code>
<p>describes "things that are birds but not penguins." This antecedent matches the data <tt>['Phil is a penguin','Javier is a bird']</tt>, because...
</p>
<ol><li> The only way to match the first constituent of the AND is with the binding <tt>(?x) = Javier</tt>.
</li><li> Applying the binding to the second constituent of the AND yields <tt>NOT( 'Javier is a penguin' )</tt>.
</li><li> <tt>'Javier is a penguin'</tt> is not in our data, hence, <tt>NOT( 'Javier is a penguin' )</tt> matches.
</li><li> So the entire AND expression successfully matches with <tt>(?x) = Javier</tt>.
</li></ol>
<p>But what happens if we <i>flip</i> the order of the two constituents? Our new antecedent looks like
</p>
<code><pre> AND( NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' ),
      '(?x) is a bird')
</pre></code>
<p>Suppose the data is still <tt>['Phil is a penguin','Sue is a penguin']</tt>. When attempting to match this rule to the data, the matcher first looks at the AND's first constituent, <tt>NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' )</tt>. But what is the value of <tt>(?x)</tt> supposed to be? There are literally an infinite number of bindings for <tt>(?x)</tt> that can make <tt>NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' )</tt> be true. In fact, there are only <i>two</i> values of <tt>(?x)</tt> that would <i>not</i> yield a match: <tt>Phil</tt> and <tt>Sue</tt>. In short, the matcher goes crazy because it has no positive guesses of what to bind <tt>(?x)</tt>
 to. We wouldn't expect a student to write down an infinite number of 
possible bindings on a quiz; neither should we expect our matcher to do 
that. 
</p><p>As such...
</p><p><b>A NOT expression should never introduce new variables</b>: our naive matcher won't know what to do with them, and it will certainly not behave as you expect it to.
</p>
<a name="Running_the_system"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Running the system </span></h2>
<p>If you call <tt>from production import forward_chain</tt>, you gain access to a procedure <tt>forward_chain(rules, data, verbose=False)</tt> that will make inferences as described in the previous sections. It's important to note that in our code, <tt>rules</tt> and <tt>data</tt> may either be supplied as lists or tuples; either is acceptable. However, it may be most appropriate to represent <tt>data</tt> as a list because it's mutable, and data may be added or removed. 
</p><p>This method returns the final state of its input data.
</p><p>Here's an example of using <tt>forward_chain</tt> with a very simple rule system:
</p>
<code><pre>from production import IF, AND, OR, NOT, THEN, DELETE, forward_chain

theft_rule = IF( 'you have (?x)',
                  THEN( 'i have (?x)' ),
                  DELETE( 'you have (?x)' ))

data = ( 'you have apple',
         'you have orange',
         'you have pear' )

print(forward_chain([theft_rule], data, verbose=True))
</pre></code>
<p>We provide the system with a list containing a single rule, called <tt>theft_rule</tt>, which replaces a datum like <tt>'you have apple'</tt> with <tt>'i have apple'</tt>. Given the three items of data, it will replace each of them in turn.
</p><p>Here is the output if you ran the code above as a Python script:
</p>
<code><pre>Rule: IF(you have (?x), THEN('i have (?x)'))
Added assertion: i have apple
Rule: IF(you have (?x), THEN('i have (?x)'))
Deleted assertion: you have apple
Rule: IF(you have (?x), THEN('i have (?x)'))
Added assertion: i have orange
Rule: IF(you have (?x), THEN('i have (?x)'))
Deleted assertion: you have orange
Rule: IF(you have (?x), THEN('i have (?x)'))
Added assertion: i have pear
Rule: IF(you have (?x), THEN('i have (?x)'))

<a name="Part_2:_Poker_Hands"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Part 2: Poker Hands </span></h2>
<p>We can use a production system to rank types of poker hands against each other. If we tell it basic things like <tt>'three-of-a-kind beats two-pair'</tt> and <tt>'two-pair beats pair'</tt>, it would make sense for it be able to deduce by transitivity that <tt>'three-of-a-kind beats pair'</tt>.
</p><p>You're given this data about poker hands:
</p>
<pre>poker_data = [ 'two-pair beats pair',
               'three-of-a-kind beats two-pair',
               'straight beats three-of-a-kind',
               'flush beats straight',
               'full-house beats flush',
               'straight-flush beats full-house' ]
</pre>
<p>Write a one-rule system that finds all other combinations of which 
poker hands beat which, transitively, given some of the rankings 
already.  For example, it should be able to deduce that a 
three-of-a-kind beats a pair, because a three-of-a-kind beats two-pair 
and a two-pair beats a pair.  The rankings (data) are all provided in 
the form <tt>'(?x) beats (?y)'</tt>.

<a name="Part_3:_Family_relations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Part 3: Family relations </span></h2>

<ul><li> <tt>'person (?x)'</tt>: <i>x</i> is a person
</li><li> <tt>'parent (?x) (?y)'</tt>: <i>x</i> is a parent of <i>y</i>
</li></ul>
<p>Every person in the data set will be explicitly defined as a person.
</p><p>Your task is to deduce, wherever you can, the following relations:
</p>
<ul><li> <tt>'sibling (?x) (?y)'</tt>: <i>x</i> is the sibling of <i>y</i> (<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are different people, but share at least one parent)
</li><li> <tt>'child (?x) (?y)'</tt>: <i>x</i> is the child of <i>y</i>
</li><li> <tt>'cousin (?x) (?y)'</tt>: <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are cousins (a parent of <i>x</i> and a parent of <i>y</i> are siblings, but <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are not siblings)

</li><li> <tt>'grandchild (?x) (?y)'</tt>: <i>x</i> is the grandchild of <i>y</i>
</li></ul>
<p><br>
Note that for this problem, you are <b>not</b> limited to only defining 
rules that generate one of the five familial relations enumerated above.
 You are welcome to include rules that inform other relations. You're 
also welcome to implement additional familial relations such as <tt>great-grandparent</tt> or <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nibling" class="external text" title="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nibling" rel="nofollow"><tt>nibling</tt></a>, if you feel so inclined.
</p><p>Keep in mind that some relations are symmetric, so you need to include them both ways. For example, if <i>a</i> is a cousin of <i>b</i>, then <i>b</i> is a cousin of <i>a</i>.
</p><p>First, define all your rules individually -- that is, give them 
names by assigning them to variables.  This will enable you to refer to 
the rules by name and easily rearrange them if you need to.  Then, put 
them together into a list in order, and call it <tt>family_rules</tt>, so that the rules can be plugged into the forward-chaining system.
</p><p>We've given you two larger sets of test data -- one for the 
Simpsons family, and one for the Black family from Harry Potter -- as 
well as a couple smaller data sets to help with debugging.  To debug 
what happened in your rules, you can set <tt>verbose=True</tt>.
</p><p><b>You will write your solution in <tt>lab1.py</tt> in the section labeled "Part 3"</b>. Note that <tt>lab1.py</tt> will automatically define a variable called <tt>black_family_cousins</tt> which will include all the <tt>'cousin (?x) (?y)'</tt> relations you find in the Black family, per your rule set. There should be 14 of them.
</p><p>IMPORTANT: Make sure you implement all five relations defined 
above.  In this lab, the online tester will be stricter, and may test 
some relations not tested offline.

<a name="Goal_trees"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Goal trees </span></h2>
<p>For the next problem, we're going to need a representation of goal 
trees. Specifically, we want to make trees out of AND and OR nodes 
(expressions), much like the ones that can be in the antecedents of 
rules. (There won't be any NOT nodes in this problem.) They will be 
represented as <tt>AND(...)</tt> and <tt>OR(...)</tt> objects.
</p>
<a name="AND_and_OR_objects"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> <tt>AND</tt> and <tt>OR</tt> objects </span></h3>
<p>In our production code, <tt>AND</tt> and <tt>OR</tt> are subclasses of <tt>RuleExpression</tt>, which itself is a subclass of the Python built-in type <tt>list</tt>. Hence, you may iterate, slice, index into, and otherwise do any other standard list-like operation on <tt>AND</tt> and <tt>OR</tt> objects.
</p><p>The leaves of the goal tree are string assertions. The goal atoms may simply be arbitrary symbols or numbers like <tt>g1</tt> or <tt>3</tt>.
</p><p>An <b>AND node</b> represents a list of sub-goals that are 
required to complete a particular goal. If all the branches of an AND 
node succeed, the AND node succeeds. <tt>AND(g1, g2, g3)</tt> describes a goal that is completed by completing g1, g2, and g3 in order. Similarly, <tt>AND</tt> can take in an iterable of arguments, so <tt>AND([g1, g2, g3])</tt> is equivalent to <tt>AND(g1, g2, g3)</tt>.
</p><p>An <b>OR node</b> is a list of options for how to complete a goal. If any one of the branches of an OR node succeeds, the OR node succeeds. <tt>OR(g1, g2, g3)</tt> is a goal that you complete by first trying g1, then g2, then g3. Similarly, <tt>OR</tt> can take in an iterable of arguments, so e.g. <tt>OR([g1, g2, g3])</tt> is equivalent to <tt>OR(g1, g2, g3)</tt>.
</p><p><b>Unconditional success</b> is represented by an AND node with no requirements: <tt>AND()</tt>.
</p><p><b>Unconditional failure</b> is represented by an OR node with no options: <tt>OR()</tt>.
</p>
<a name="Simplifying_Nodes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Simplifying Nodes </span></h3>
<p>A problem with goal trees is that you can end up with trees that are 
described differently but mean exactly the same thing. For example, 
</p>
<pre>AND(g1, AND(g2, AND(AND(), g3, g4)))
</pre>
<p>is more reasonably expressed as 
</p>
<pre>AND(g1, g2, g3, g4)
</pre>
<p>So, we've provided a function called <tt>simplify</tt> that reduces some of these cases to the same tree. <tt>simplify</tt>
 won't change the order of any nodes, but it will prune some nodes that 
are fruitless to check, and otherwise simplify more complicated nodes 
when possible.
</p><p><b>We have provided this code for you.</b> However, you should 
still understand what it's doing, because you can benefit from its 
effects. You may want to write code that produces "messy" and 
unsimplified goal trees, because it's easier, and then simplify them 
with the <tt>simplify</tt> function.
</p><p>This is how <tt>simplify</tt> simplifies goal trees:
</p>
<ol><li> If a node contains another node of the same type, absorb it into the parent node. So <tt>OR(g1, OR(g2, g3), g4)</tt> becomes <tt>OR(g1 g2 g3 g4)</tt>.
</li><li> Any AND node that contains an unconditional failure (<tt>OR()</tt>) has no way to succeed, so replace it with unconditional failure.
</li><li> Any OR node that contains an unconditional success (<tt>AND()</tt>) will always succeed, so replace it with unconditional success.
</li><li> If a node has only one branch, replace it with that branch. <tt>AND(g1)</tt>, <tt>OR(g1)</tt>, and <tt>g1</tt> all represent the same goal.
</li><li> If a node has multiple instances of a variable, replace these with only one instance. <tt>AND(g1, g1, g2)</tt> is the same as <tt>AND(g1, g2)</tt>.
</li></ol>
<p>Below are some examples of <tt>simplify</tt> in action:
</p>
<code><pre> simplify(OR(1, 2, AND()))                                     =&gt; AND()
 simplify(OR(1, 2, AND(3, AND(4)), AND(5)))                    =&gt; OR(1, 2, AND(3, 4), 5)
 simplify(AND('g1', AND('g2', AND('g3', AND('g4', AND())))))   =&gt; AND('g1', 'g2', 'g3', 'g4')
 simplify(AND('g'))                                            =&gt; 'g'
 simplify(AND('g1', 'g1', 'g2'))                               =&gt; AND('g1', 'g2')
</pre></code>

<a name="Going_Backwards"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Going Backwards </span></h2>
<p><i>Backward chaining</i> is the opposite of forward chaining: we run a
 production rule system in reverse. We start with a conclusion (the 
hypothesis), and then we find which rules, when fired, would yield that 
hypothesis. Then, we test those rules' antecedents to figure out how we 
can successfully match them against data we have or other rules' 
consequents.
</p>
<a name="The_Backward_Chaining_Process"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> The Backward Chaining Process </span></h3>
<p>Here's the general theory behind backward chaining:
</p>
<ul><li> Given a hypothesis, you want to see what rules can produce it, 
by matching the consequents of those rules against your hypothesis. All 
of the rules' consequents that match are possible options, so you'll 
take the corresponding antecedents and group them together in an OR 
node: it is sufficient for any <i>one</i> matching rule to fire and yield the hypothesis.
</li><li> The hypothesis itself should be added as a (leaf) node to the 
OR node, because existence of the hypothesis in the data is sufficient 
to conclude the hypothesis.
</li><li> If a consequent matches, keep track of the variables that are 
bound. Look up the antecedent of that rule, and instantiate those same 
variables in the antecedent (that is, replace the variables with their 
values). This instantiated antecedent is a new hypothesis.
</li><li> The antecedent may have AND or OR expressions. This means that
 the goal tree for the antecedent is already partially formed. But you 
need to check the leaves of that AND-OR tree, and recursively backward 
chain on them.
</li></ul>
<p>A few things you should be aware of:
</p>
<ul><li> The branches of the goal tree should be in order: the goal 
trees for earlier rules should appear before (to the left of) the goal 
trees for later rules. Intermediate nodes should appear before their 
expansions.
</li><li> The output should be fully simplified (you can use the <tt>simplify</tt> function).
</li><li> If two different rules tell you to check the same hypothesis, 
the goal tree for that hypothesis should be included both times, even 
though it's largely redundant.
</li></ul>
<a name="Part_4:_Backward_Chaining"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Part 4: Backward Chaining </span></h2>
<p>In this problem, we will do backward chaining by starting from a conclusion, and generating a goal tree of <i>all</i> of the statements we may need to test. The leaves of the goal tree will be sentences (strings) like <tt>'opus swims'</tt>, indicating atomic failure or success based on whether or not 'opus swims' is in our assertions list.
</p><p>We'll run this backward chainer on the <tt>zookeeper</tt> system of rules, a simple set of production rules for classifying animals, which you will find in <tt>data.py</tt>. As an example, here is the goal tree generated for the hypothesis <tt>'opus is a penguin'</tt>:
</p>
<code><pre>OR(
  'opus is a penguin',
  AND(
    OR('opus is a bird', 'opus has feathers', AND('opus flies', 'opus lays eggs'))
    'opus does not fly',
    'opus swims',
    'opus has black and white color' ))
</pre></code>
<p>You will write a procedure, <tt>backchain_to_goal_tree(rules, hypothesis)</tt> (in "Part 4" of <tt>lab1.py</tt>),
 which outputs the goal tree containing the statements you would need to
 test to prove the hypothesis.  Note that this function is supposed to 
be a general backchainer, so you should not hard-code anything that is 
specific to a particular rule set.  The backchainer will be tested on 
rule sets other than <tt>zookeeper_rules</tt>.
</p><p>The rules you work with will be limited in scope, because 
general-purpose backward chainers are difficult to write. In particular,
 for this problem, make the following assumptions:
</p>
<ul><li> All variables that appear in a rule's antecedent also appear in
 its consequent (so there are no "unknown" variables in the antecedent).
 In other words, you will not need to do backtracking.
</li><li> All assertions are positive: no rules will have DELETE clauses or NOT expressions.
</li><li> Rule antecedents never have nested <tt>RuleExpression</tt> nodes. For example, something like <tt>(OR (AND x y) (AND z w))</tt> will never appear within an antecedent, because that comprises an AND expression nested under an OR expression.
</li><li> Rule consequents always have just a single statement.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that an antecedent can be a single hypothesis (a string) or a <tt>RuleExpression</tt>.

trying to figure out how everything works, we use this section to 
provide you with a quick explanation of which functions you will find 
useful and how you should interact with them.
</p>
<dl><dt><tt>match(pattern, datum)</tt>
</dt><dd>This attempts to assign values to variables so that <tt>pattern</tt> and <tt>datum</tt> are the same. You can <tt>match(leaf_a, leaf_b)</tt>, which returns either <tt>None</tt> if <tt>leaf_a</tt> didn't match <tt>leaf_b</tt>, or a set of bindings if it did (even empty bindings: <tt>{}</tt>).
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Examples:
<dl><dd><tt>match("(?x) is a (?y)", "John is a student") =&gt; { x: "John", y: "student" }</tt>
</dd><dd><tt>match("foo", "bar") =&gt; None</tt>
</dd><dd><tt>match("foo", "foo") =&gt; {}</tt>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Both arguments to <tt>match</tt> must be strings.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Note: <tt>{}</tt> and <tt>None</tt> are both <tt>False</tt>-like values in Python, so you should make sure to explicitly check if <tt>match</tt>'s return value is <tt>None</tt> (i.e. don't use idioms like "<tt>if match(a, b):</tt>"). If <tt>match</tt> returns <tt>{}</tt>, that means that the statements match but there are no variables that need to be bound, whereas if <tt>match</tt> returns <tt>None</tt>, that means it's not possible for the statements to match at all!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><tt>populate(exp, bindings)</tt>
</dt><dd>Given an expression with variables in it, look up the values of those variables in <tt>bindings</tt> and replace the variables with their values. You can use the bindings from <tt>match(leaf_a, leaf_b)</tt> with <tt>populate(leaf, bindings)</tt>, which will fill in any free variables using the bindings. Note that the expression input to <tt>populate</tt> may either be a string or a more complicated tree.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Examples:
<dl><dd><tt>populate("(?x) is a (?y)", { x: "John", y: "student" }) =&gt; "John is a student"</tt>

<dl><dd>Recall that <tt>RuleExpression</tt> objects act like lists, so 
you can iterate over them. If you need to know to what class an
